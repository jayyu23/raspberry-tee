# ATECC608A API

This part of the project provides a signing interface to the ATECC608A chip with `keygen`, `sign`, and `verify` functions. It uses the NIST P256 elliptic curve.

Python helper scripts are used to generate, sign, and verify sample NIST P256 ECDSA keys and messages.

See ATECC608A-TFLXTLS datasheet DS40002138A-page 17 for details on the ECC256R1 curve.

In this part, the ATECC608A signed transactions should be able to be verified by the Python p256 script, and any signature generated by the Python p256 script should be verified by the ATECC608A.
