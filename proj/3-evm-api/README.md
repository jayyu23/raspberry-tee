# Ethereum Virtual Machine API

*Note: Because the ATECC608A chip uses the P256 elliptic curve, rather than Ethereum's secp256k1 curve, the signatures generated cannot actually be broadcasted onto an EVM blockchain. However, suppose that the ATECC608A (pk, sk) pair was generated on secp256k1 curve. We should use the generated (pk, sk) pair to sign EVM-style transactions, and the signatures should be verifiable by the ATECC608A.*

This part of the project makes the ATECC608A chip act as an Ethereum account. It should be able to sign transactions and verify signatures. Functionalities include:
- Converting `pk` generated by the ATECC608A to an Ethereum Externally Owned Account (EOA) address
- Generating an EVM style signed transaction to send ether from the ATECC608A account to any EOA address
- Sign an EIP-191 message, and verify the signature

For this prototype, we assume everything happens on the P256 curve, which is what the ATECC608A uses.

See [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) for details on the ECDSA signature scheme.
